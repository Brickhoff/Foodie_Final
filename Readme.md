This is a individual course project for CSCE 608 using Node.js, Express and MySQL.

I used Cloud9 to develope this project so it is best to clone and test the project in Cloud9.
If you don't use cloud9, you need to change the code for database connection and local development host port.

1. clone the repo.
2. mysql-ctl cli
3. Create your own database. If you want to use the default name, name your database "Foodie".
4. use foodie;
5. Change the "user" in database.js to your username. If the development environment is not in Cloud9, change the username and host,
   and you need to add code for "password."
6. In mysql console, run foodie.sql.
7. Open another terminal, in the correct directory, run "node app.js".
